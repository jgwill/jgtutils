# Ledger: jgtcore Makefile and Build System Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-13 14:25  
**Topic:** Fix jgtcore build system and Makefile execution  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

## Intention
Fix the jgtcore project build system so that:
1. `make` commands execute properly
2. `bump_version.py` works with jgtcore instead of jgtutils  
3. Build/distribution works with pyproject.toml (no setup.py needed)
4. Version management works correctly across all files

## Current State
- `bump_version.py` is hardcoded for jgtutils paths
- Makefile has syntax errors and wrong package references
- Build system relies on pyproject.toml but Makefile references missing setup.py
- Version detection in Makefile is broken

## Issues Identified
1. **bump_version.py**: Looks for `jgtutils/__init__.py` instead of `jgtcore/__init__.py`
2. **Makefile line 1**: Syntax error in version detection
3. **Makefile line 6**: Invalid virtualenv/conda command
4. **Makefile line 15**: References wrong package name (jgtutils vs jgtcore)
5. **Makefile**: References setup.py which doesn't exist
6. **Makefile**: Duplicate test targets

## Evolution
- [x] Fix bump_version.py to work with jgtcore package structure
- [x] Fix Makefile version detection  
- [x] Update Makefile package references
- [x] Remove setup.py dependencies
- [x] Test the build process
- [x] Verify version bumping works correctly
- [x] Fix license format warning in pyproject.toml
- [x] Fix test imports to use jgtcore.core
- [x] Add required dev dependencies (build, twine, coverage)
- [x] Test all make targets (test, format, clean, dist, bump_version)

## Completed Work

### Fixed bump_version.py:
- Changed from `jgtutils/__init__.py` to `jgtcore/__init__.py`
- Updated regex to match `__version__ = "..."` format
- Fixed pyproject.toml version updating
- Removed package.json references (not used by jgtcore)

### Fixed Makefile:
- Fixed version detection: `python3 -c 'import jgtcore; print(jgtcore.__version__)'`
- Removed virtualenv command, added proper pip installation
- Changed package references from jgtutils to jgtcore
- Updated test command to use pytest properly
- Added coverage and black formatting
- Removed setup.py dependencies, using `python3 -m build`
- Added build tools to dev dependencies

### Fixed pyproject.toml:
- Updated license format from `{text = "MIT"}` to `"MIT"`
- Added missing dev dependencies: build, twine, coverage

### Fixed tests:
- Updated import from `import core` to `import jgtcore.core as core`

## Working Build Process
1. `make test` - Runs pytest with coverage (6 tests pass, 56% coverage)
2. `make format` - Formats code with isort and black
3. `make clean` - Removes build artifacts
4. `make dist` - Builds source and wheel distributions (no deprecation warnings)
5. `make bump_version` - Increments patch version in __init__.py and pyproject.toml
6. All distributions build successfully without setup.py

## Final State
The jgtcore project now has a fully functional build system:
- ✅ Version bumped from 0.1.1 → 0.1.4 during testing
- ✅ All Makefile targets work correctly
- ✅ Uses pyproject.toml exclusively (no setup.py needed)
- ✅ Modern packaging with `python3 -m build`
- ✅ Complete development workflow from test → format → bump → build → distribute
- ✅ Ready for PyPI releases with twine

**Result:** jgtcore can now execute all `make` commands successfully for a modern Python package development workflow.
